# Audio-Classification
I've created an audio classifier here - which will classify the audio into two categories - neutral and angry.
Fot the dataset, I've used my own voice samples - 60 Neutral audio files and 50 Angry audio files.

The audio recordings have to be converted into '.wav' format. Any free online converter can be used for that.
